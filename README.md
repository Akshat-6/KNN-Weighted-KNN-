# KNN-Weighted-KNN-
A pure Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Weighted KNN algorithms on the Iris dataset, built from scratch without using libraries like scikit-learn.


# Iris-KNN-WeightedKNN-NoLibrary

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project provides a from-scratch implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Weighted KNN algorithms using the famous Iris flower dataset.  
The focus is on learning and demonstrating how the KNN algorithm works internally, **without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, or pandas**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is a well-known multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher. It consists of 150 instances belonging to three species of Iris flowers:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica

Each instance has the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## ðŸš€ Algorithms Implemented
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  
  Classifies based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors using Euclidean distance.

- **Weighted KNN:**  
  Assigns weights to neighbors based on inverse distance, giving closer neighbors more influence in classification.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered
- Euclidean Distance Calculation
- Majority Voting
- Distance-Based Weighting
- Accuracy Evaluation
- Manual Train-Test Split
